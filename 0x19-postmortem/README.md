Incident Report/ Postmortem.

Working in IT, we all know that from time to time, things go off the rails, despite our planning and best intentions. When things go really wrong, you might be asked to write an Incident Report that can be shared with senior executives, fellow staff, or even customers. I recommend you go through this process whether anyone will read these or not, since it can serve as a guide, and you will be analyzing your environment when things go wrong, and building ways to prevent the same types of failures moving forward.

 The report is made up of five parts, an issue summary, a timeline, root cause analysis, resolution and recovery, and lastly, corrective and preventative measures. Lets review each of these parts in detail.

 Issue Summary:
 - Short summary (5 sentences)
 - List the duration along with the start and end times(including timezone)
 - State the impact (user requests resulted in 500 errors, at peak 100%)
 - Close with root cause.

 Timelines:
 - List the time zone
 - Cover the outange duration
 - When outage begun
 - When staff was notified
 - Actions, events
 - When service was restored

 Root cause:
 - Give detailed explanation of event
 - Do not sugarcoat

 Resolution and recovery:
 - Give detailed explanation of actions taken(include times)

 Corrective and preventative measures:
 - Suggest list of ways to prevent it from happening again
 - What can we do better next time
